# SYMBA-HEP

Computing squared amplitudes of feynman diagrams from amplitudes is an $O(N^2)$ problem in high energy physics. To reduce the complexity of the problem solving, we instead attempt to map a amplitudes to a simplified form of squared amplitudes, dramatically decreasing the computation time.
